3D Demo 1.11
Paul Berlin 2002

IMPORTANT INFO
--------------
3D Demo takes use of the fmod sound library from
Firelight Technologies and requires the fmod.dll
file. It can be downloaded from the fmod website
at http://www.fmod.org or you can rename the 
fmod.dll_ file to fmod.dll.

There is also an compiled version of 3D Demo
included, renamed to 3D.exe_ in case
you are having problems compiling.

Look in readme.html for further information.
